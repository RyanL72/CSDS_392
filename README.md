# CSDS_392: CWRU iOS Development Projects

**Applications made for CWRU iOS Development Spring 2025**

Welcome to the CSDS_392 repository—a curated collection of iOS development projects that chronicle my journey from mastering Swift basics to building fully functional applications. Each project builds on the previous one, illustrating my progressive learning and application of iOS development techniques.

## Learning Path

The projects in this repository are arranged in the order in which I acquired new skills:

1. **Swift Syntax**  
   *Learn the basics of Swift programming.*  
   This project covers fundamental concepts like variables, control flow, functions, and basic data structures.

2. **To Do List**  
   *A basic to-do list application.*  
   Here, I applied Swift fundamentals to build a simple, interactive to-do list, focusing on UI development and state management.

3. **Remind Me App**  
   *Manage reminders with priority settings.*  
   This app lets you add, modify, and remove reminders, as well as set their priority. It deepened my understanding of user interaction and data persistence.

4. **Networking App**  
   *Display a UUID fetched from a URL.*  
   In this project, I integrated networking capabilities by making HTTP requests, parsing responses, and updating the UI with a fetched UUID. This was my first exploration into asynchronous programming and network data handling.

5. **Comic App**  
   *Fetch and display the XKCD comic of the day.*  
   By integrating API calls and handling image data, this app shows how to fetch dynamic content and manage permissions effectively.

6. **Library Notes App (SwiftLN)**  
   *Create and store notes about books using SwiftData.*  
   This project introduced local data storage with SwiftData, focusing on creating and managing notes. It enhanced my skills in data persistence and complex UI interactions.

7. **Multi View Attendee App (MultiDev)**  
   *Display a list of event attendees with adaptive UI for different orientations.*  
   This project focuses on building responsive applications that adjust to various device orientations, enhancing the overall user experience.

8. **AttendeeCheckerApp**  
   *A fully functional app (with the right entitlements) to manage event attendees.*  
   This application integrates advanced features and best practices, solidifying my understanding of real-world app requirements and security entitlements.

9. **Find Me App**  
   *Track user location with proper permissions.*  
   In this project, I learned how to handle device permissions and integrate location services to track and display the user’s current location.

10. **CWRU Map App**  
    *Display locations on the CWRU campus.*  
    The final project utilizes mapping frameworks to display campus locations, integrating geolocation and map view customization to provide a comprehensive navigation experience.
